Analysis of video rental data of a film rental company using SQL


The Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. The goal of this project is to load all of Rockbusterâ€™s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, use SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that departments may have.
